My Portfolio Website
This website will include all the details of each project i have started. The purpose of this website is to not only be a showcase my skills in the hopes for future employment,  but will helpe reinforce the teachings that each project brings. Whether thats new expressions in Java for more efficient and swifter code, or new tools used in Blender to make smoother and more precise models. This website will contain all the documentation of the things i learn, so that i will be able to reinforce these new ideas.
